  label: "The Open Source Research Experience (OSRE) program provides support for undergraduate and graduate students contributing to open source projects and reproducible research efforts. With its dual focus on both increasing open source communities and making computational research efforts reproducible, the OSRE supports a wide variety of projects. In connection with the OSRE, the UCSC OSPO has taken part in the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) as a mentor organization and managed other sponsored programs such as the NSF funded [Summer of Reproducibility](https://ucsc-ospo.github.io/sor24/).  Information from past OSRE years can be found here: [2023](/osre23) and [2022](https://cross.ucsc.edu/2022-osre/index.html) ([final 2022 reports](/post/20220929)).  

Mentors interested in participating in the OSRE (including for projects relevant to GSoC and the SoR) can [post their project ideas](https://ucsc-ospo.github.io/osredocs/formentors/) for students to review. [Project ideas](#projects) are short abstracts that provide an overview of the tasks students will accomplish over the summer.  See [mentor page](#formentors) for more details.

Interested Students or other newcomers to open source or reproducibility should review these project ideas and work with mentors to develop a full proposal. Student projects are due by April 4, 2024. See [student information page](#forstudents) for more details.
