If you are interested, have a look at our [guidelines for students](/osredocs/forstudents), which includes timelines on when to contact mentors and proposal guidelines and expectations. 

Mentor project ideas will be published beginning in January and updated through February. Students are asked to wait to reach out to mentors until late February 2025. The proposal deadline is expected to be late March / early April. 

Students interested in applying to any of our projects **should join our Slack channel** before March 20. This channel will open for students in February and a link will be provided then. 

You can also use our Gitter channel for **general questions** before reaching out to mentors. https://gitter.im/uc_ospo-osre/community

We typically support the work of undergraduate students; however graduate students may also apply to work on more advanced project ideas. Please check out the project ideas page and contact the mentor if you have questions.
