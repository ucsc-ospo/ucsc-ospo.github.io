As a Software Engineer her most keen interest is to engineer proper softwares especially for Electronics Design Automation, She has engineered an all in one Verification Suite for RISC-V based cores known as "Burq-Suite". She is co-inventor of "ChipShop" that is basically a cloud based solution in form a web app for rapid prototyping and generation of complete System on Chips (SoCs) and also process them towards prototyping for ASICs and FPGA. She has presented this project in "First Chipyard and FireSim Workshop at ASPLOS'23" and "RISC-V Summit Europe 2023". She is dedicated, outcome oriented and focused with her work and aspirations.
