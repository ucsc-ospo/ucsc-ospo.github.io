Dustin Richmond is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Engineering in the Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz. Dustin completed his postdoc in the Bespoke Silicon Group at the Paul Allen School of Computer Science at the University of Washington, and earned his Ph.D. from the University of California, San Diego. His research interests are in the design of flexible and secure architectures that can generalize across applications, evolve with software, and dynamically adapt to changes in data. His prior work includes HammerBlade, a flexible supercomputer funded by DARPA; RIFFA: A Reconfigurable Interface for FPGA Accelerators, which won a Community Best Paper Award at the 2013 International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic; and contributions to the PYNQ project at Xilinx. He is an NSF Graduate Research Fellow and an ARCS Fellow. He won the Outstanding Community Leader Award from the UC San Diego Graduate Student Association, and the Excellence in Service and Leadership Award from the UC San Diego Computer Science and Engineering Department. Last, but not least, he also won the Best Social Hour Theme Award for teaching other students the basics of lock picking by locking all the Friday afternoon event food in metal boxes.
