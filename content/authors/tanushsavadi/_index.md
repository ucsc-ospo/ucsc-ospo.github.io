Hi, I’m Tanush—a rising senior at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics and graduating in Spring 2026. Currently, I’m an AI Intern with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Department of Unemployment Assistance, where I’m developing an end-to-end retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) chatbot on AWS.

I’ve also contributed to the CarbonCast project by designing a user interface to help visualize carbon intensity forecasts. Previously, I worked at MathWorks as a Machine Learning Intern, where I collaborated in an AGILE environment to design and deploy predictive models that improved precision torque control and dynamic responsiveness in motor-driven robotics and industrial systems.
