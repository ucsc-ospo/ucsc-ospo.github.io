João Felipe Pimentel is a post-doc at the Northern Arizona University (NAU). He is working on several research projects related to (i) designing chatbots to support the learning of programming and ML; (ii) collecting, managing, and analyzing provenance from scripts; (iii) supporting the onboarding of newcomers and underrepresented groups in OSS projects; and (iv) mining software repositories to understand the quality and reproducibility of jupyter notebooks, how tests are designed, and how projects use database systems.

During his PhD at Fluminense Federal University (UFF), he participated in a Sandwich PhD at NYU, where he started the work on mining GitHub repositories with interactive notebooks. This work received both the FOSS Impact Paper Award and the ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award for its publication at the International Conference on Mining Software Repositories.
