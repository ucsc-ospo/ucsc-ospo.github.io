I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of California, Irvine, where I was advised by Prof. Jing Zhang. I received my B.S. degree from the College of Control Science and Technology, Zhejiang University.

My main research goal is to develop trustworthy computational methods to understand single-cell gene regulation, particularly in spatial contexts, and to translate these insights into applications for disease understanding and drug discovery.

Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of California, Irvine, where I continue to work on AI-driven approaches for single-cell and spatial genomics.
