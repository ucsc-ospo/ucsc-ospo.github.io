I am a third-year CS Ph.D. student at the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu/), advised by Prof. [Jing Zhang](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~jingz31/). 
Previously, I graduated from the [College of Control Science and Technology, Zhejiang University](http://www.cse.zju.edu.cn/english/). 
During my undergrad, I was fortunate to work with Prof. [Xiaoqian Wang](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~joywang/), [Yueyang Wang](http://www.cse.cqu.edu.cn/info/2097/5067.htm), [Quanzheng Li](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/camca/people/li-quanzheng-phd), and [Fei Wu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/wufei). 

Now, I am interested in computational biology and machine learning.
