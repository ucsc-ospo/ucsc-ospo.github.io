Mrigank is junior undergrad pursuing mathematics and computing at the Indian Institute of Science in Bengaluru. He is most interested in software engineering, programming languages, and applications of large language models for code generation. He also enjoys both teaching, like through volunteering or by leading student-club activities, and also exploring the pedagogical implications of his work. When away from work, he might be hacking code, listening to his favorite music, [writing on his blog](https://mrigank.in/musings/), or occasionally playing badminton. When he was in high school, he loved developing websites and apps that he thought could fix the world.
