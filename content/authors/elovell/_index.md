Dr. Emily Lovell is the Associate Director of the UC Santa Cruz Open Source Program Office. She also holds a faculty appointment in the Computer Science and Engineering department, supporting new contributors through research, teaching, and mentorship. Emily previously served on faculty at [Berea College](https://www.berea.edu), where she developed and taught courses on open source contribution and computational craft. She has also co-taught physical computing workshops at a variety of venues domestically and abroad, including outreach programs, design schools, museums, and festivals. Motivated by a desire to make e-textiles more accessible, Emily designed a low-cost, pre-programmed sewable microcontroller known as the [LilyTiny](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10899) â€“ which is open source and has been commercially available as part of the LilyPad Arduino product line for over ten years now. She has a S.M. in Media Arts & Sciences from the [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu) and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from [UC Santa Cruz](https://www.ucsc.edu). Emily lives in the Santa Cruz Mountains with her rescue pup, Daphne.
