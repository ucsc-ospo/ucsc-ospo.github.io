Carlos Maltzahn [retired](/post/20231215/) from UC Santa Cruz on December 15, 2023. He was the founder and director of the [UC Santa Cruz Center for Research in Open Source Software (CROSS)](https://cross.ucsc.edu) and the [Open Source Program Office (OSPO) UC Santa Cruz](https://ospo.ucsc.edu).

Carlos joined UC Santa Cruz in 2004, after five years at Netapp working on network-intermediaries and storage systems. In 2005 he co-founded and became a key mentor on [Sage Weil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sage_Weil)’s [Ceph project](https://ceph.io). In 2008 Carlos became a member of the computer science faculty at UC Santa Cruz and has graduated ten Ph.D. students since. Carlos graduated with a M.S. and Ph.D. in Computer Science from University of Colorado at Boulder.
