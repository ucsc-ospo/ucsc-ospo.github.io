I'm Aditya Narayan, pursuing my Senior year in Computer Science. I find myself drawn to the abstract world of theoretical CS, the pragmatic domain of operations, and the art of crafting efficient, high-performance systems.

My free time is often spent enjoying a good book on interior design and architecture, all while savoring a cup of coffee.
