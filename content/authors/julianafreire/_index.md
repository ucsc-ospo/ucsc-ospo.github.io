Juliana Freire is a Professor of Computer Science and Data Science at New York University.  She was the elected chair of the ACM Special Interest Group on Management of Data (SIGMOD), served as a council member of the Computing Research Associationâ€™s Computing Community Consortium (CCC), and was the NYU lead investigator for the Moore-Sloan Data Science Environment,  a $32.8 million grant awarded jointly to UW, NYU, and UC Berkeley. She develops methods and systems that enable a wide range of users to obtain trustworthy insights from data. This spans topics in large-scale data analysis and integration, visualization, machine learning, provenance management, and web information discovery, and different application areas, including urban analytics, predictive modeling, and computational reproducibility. Freire has co-authored over 200 technical papers (including 11 award-winning publications), several open-source systems, and is an inventor of 12 U.S. patents. According to Google Scholar, her h-index is 61 and her work has received over 16,000 citations. She is an ACM Fellow, a AAAS Fellow, and a recipient of an NSF CAREER, two IBM Faculty awards, and a Google Faculty Research award.  She was awarded the ACM SIGMOD Contributions Award in 2020. Her research has been funded by the National Science Foundation, DARPA, Department of Energy, National Institutes of Health, Sloan Foundation, Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, W. M. Keck Foundation, Google, Amazon, AT&T Research, Microsoft Research, Yahoo! and IBM. She received a B.S. degree in computer science from the Federal University of Ceara (Brazil), and M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from the State University of New York at Stony Brook.
