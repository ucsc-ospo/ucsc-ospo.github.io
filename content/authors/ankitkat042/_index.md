Ankit Kumar is a BTech student at IIIT Delhi graduating in 2025, with experience in software development, research in network systems and a little bit of cryptography. He has worked as a Software Developer at CloudLabs, a platform that facilitates remote access to FPGA boards founded by Dr. Sumit J Darak, and as a data mining intern at TaskTracker.in.

Currently, he is an undergraduate researcher under Dr. Mukulika Maity, focusing on benchmarking QUIC and TCP protocols across different environments including bare metal, virtual machines, and containers. His research interests span high-performance computing, network performance analysis, and distributed systems.

As part of the OSRE 2025 program, Ankit is working on the SciStream project at Argonne National Laboratory, focusing on benchmarking security protocols and exploring QUIC proxies for scientific data streaming applications.
