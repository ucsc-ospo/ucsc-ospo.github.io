Meng Wang is a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Chicago under the guidance of Professor Haryadi S. Gunawi. His research focuses on enhancing the performance and dependability of storage systems, with a primary emphasis on three areas:
- Firstly, he aims to improve the system performance stability by mitigating tail latencies in cloud storage systems.
- Secondly, he specializes in designing and analyzing erasure coding techniques to improve the fault tolerance of large-scale storage systems.
- Lastly, he is working on optimizing the storage layer of machine learning training systems.
