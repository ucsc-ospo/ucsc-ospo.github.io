New this year is the **Summer of Reproducibility** with research projects around producing and using [reproducibility artifacts](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-and-badging-current) (see also [ctuning.org](https://ctuning.org/ae/) and [sysartifacts](https://sysartifacts.github.io)). Quite a few [conferences](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1--Q2D0YwgNxqUfQjJohni61d554r3HpPmnjUSaKRRKQ/edit?usp=sharing) are now offering awards for reproducibility artifacts. This encourages authors to *produce* reproducibility artifacts. There is great potential for *using* these artifacts not only for validating research results but also as teaching tools in classrooms and as baselines in research labs. Making producing and using reproducibility artifacts easier can significantly accelerate the rate of insights. The Summer of Reproducibility gives summer students the opportunity to help out in this cutting-edge effort and acquire valuable skills related to reproducibility.
