## The 1-Minute Pitch

{{< youtube FTI245WykIg >}}

## About

Open source research efforts within the University of California face many challenges, including

- Educating students to be productive in open source projects
- Revealing the value of open source to the UC system
- Broadening engagement with industry, government, and foundations

Led by {{% mention "carlosm" %}} and {{% mention "slieggi" %}} the OSPO is

- Developing a "marketplace" of open source software projects across the UC system and associated national labs that brings mentors, students, sponsors, and open source stakeholders together
- Establishing a postdoctoral "incubator fellowship" which will enable fellows to grow communities around their research prototypes  
- Organizing a yearly undergraduate "Open Source Research Experience", a UC-wide mentor organization that works with Google Summer of Code and other global outreach efforts and engages with industry, government, and foundation sponsorships
- Creating partnerships with innovative open source teaching initiatives inside and outside the UC system
