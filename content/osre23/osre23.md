The 2023 Open Source Research Experience plans to apply to be a GSoC mentor organization in 2023, under the name "OSPO UC Santa Cruz" instead of "CROSS". [CROSS](https://cross.ucsc.edu) pioneered the Open Source Research Experience (OSRE) within the UC Santa Cruz campus. In 2022, CROSS expanded OSRE to include mentors across multiple University of California campuses and has now transitioned this program to the OSPO to expand it even further. Project ideas are listed [below](#projects).

In addition to UC research projects, new this year is the [Summer of Reproducibility](/sor23) with research projects around producing and using [reproducibility artifacts](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-and-badging-current) (see also [ctuning.org](https://ctuning.org/ae/) and [sysartifacts](https://sysartifacts.github.io)). Quite a few [conferences](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1--Q2D0YwgNxqUfQjJohni61d554r3HpPmnjUSaKRRKQ/edit?usp=sharing) are now offering awards for reproducibility artifacts. This encourages authors to *produce* reproducibility artifacts. There is great potential for *using* these artifacts not only for validating research results but also as teaching tools in classrooms and as baselines in research labs. Making producing and using reproducibility artifacts easier can significantly accelerate the rate of insights. The Summer of Reproducibility gives summer students the opportunity to help out in this cutting-edge effort and acquire valuable skills related to reproducibility. 

{{% callout note %}}
Summer of Reproducibility projects do *not* need to have at least one UC-affliated mentor.
