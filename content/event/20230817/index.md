The introduction of computational data management services into the I/O stack, especially in storage and networking devices, requires both technological innovations and new relations between university and industry. This one-day workshop will convene experts from storage systems, open source, and community architecture to discuss technologies and strategies for a computational I/O stack with low market entry barriers.

The workshop will take place on August 17, 2023 from 10am to 5pm, at UC Santa Cruz, Engineering 2 (room to be confirmed) and is jointly organized by the [IEEE Magnetics Society's Distinguished Lecturers Program][web-ieee-lecturers], the Skyhook Data Management community with funding by the National Science Foundation ([TI-2229773][web-nsf-award]), the Center for Research in Open Source Software ([cross.ucsc.edu][web-cross]), and the Open Source Program Office, UC Santa Cruz ([ospo.ucsc.edu][web-ospo]).
