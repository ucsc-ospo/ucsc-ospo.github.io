The United Nations and UC Santa Cruz's Baskin School of Engineering are partnering to host the West Coast's first "Reboot the Earth" hackathon on November 7-8, 2025, at the UC Santa Cruz Silicon Valley Center. The event will bring together developers to create technological solutions addressing the climate crisis, specifically focusing on wildfire detection, response, and impactâ€”challenges particularly relevant to California. Participants will work with open source tools, artificial intelligence, and open data sets to build solutions that can serve as digital public goods for local communities, with winning teams receiving six months of coaching from UN and Salesforce partners to scale their innovations.
