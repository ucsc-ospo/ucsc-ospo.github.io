# Overview

The Open Source Symposium is organized by the [UC Santa Cruz Open Source Program Office](https://ospo.ucsc.edu/) (OSPO) and attendees must adhere to [our event code of conduct](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQMA4vVjqQYmAvSRpjOemfBJUb-1NsBThQSvJOrECzyYJz9myHrqdr6DBV2oFFBpvFeQ7TG_Sn793SZ/pub).

**The symposium is a hybrid event, hosted at the UC Santa Cruz Hay Barn on October 1.** (In-person attendance is highly encouraged, but online participation is also welcome.) The schedule features keynotes, panels, and workshops with experts from industry, academia, and open source communities.

**Our 14th Annual Oktoberfest reception will follow the main program.** 

This year's event will be free this year! However, we welcome voluntary donations and sponsorship to support event costs; [please see the end of this page](#sponsorship) if you are interested.
