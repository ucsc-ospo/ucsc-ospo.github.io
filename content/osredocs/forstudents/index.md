## How to apply to the be a contributor in our summer programs

1. Take a look at the current year's project ideas and refer to the timeline for exact dates.
2. Between **late February** and **mid March**, select projects of interest, contact mentor(s), and tell them your motivation and provide them with your relevant background/experience. You are strongly encouraged to apply to no more than two projects.
3. **Join the slack channel for contributor applicants**. You should contact the Organization Admins for access. Note that we will only review proposals of contributors who have also joined our slack channel by the deadline stated on the timeline. Use this time to also get to know the project to which you are applying and the members of the project community. You are highly encouraged to ask questions. 
4. Be prepared to provide mentors with some examples of your technical knowledge as an initial step. For instance, mentors may ask you to carry out a technical test or show work you have done in the past to assess your knowledge. This is an important step for ensuring you are proposing something that is beneficial to you, the mentor and the community. We have opportunities for contributors with a wide range of skill levels, so do not worry about "passing" the test - just show what your skill levels are and areas you are interested to grow in. 
5. Once you and the mentor have established your level of proficiency and how it fits within project ideas, you may receive feedback from the mentor on writing the proposal. Each mentor or mentor team will establish their own process for reviewing and commenting on the work of interested students. 
*Note --  **DO NOT RELY ON AI TOOLS** for your proposal writing or showing your competence. Mentors need to see your work in order to judge if you are a good fit and will be successful in your project. While you can utilize tools to refine you project if necessary **YOU WILL BE EXPECTED TO BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN ANY AND ALL WORK THAT YOU PRESENT TO THE MENTORS** and the application text must be your origianal work. We prohibit the use of AI tools for generating your project deliverables. Misuse of AI tools will be grounds from removal from the program.* 
5. Keep track of that year's project deadlines. Proposal must be turned in on time and include:
    - A detailed plan of work with an estimate of the time needed (typically 175 or 375 hours in total). See below for a [suggested template](#suggested-proposal-template).
    - Well defined tasks and their objectives, list of deliverables
    - Note: any committments that could impact the amount of time you can spend on the project.
    - Submit via the [GSoC portal](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)
6. Mentors will provide a ranked list of proposals to Org Admins. Results are made public in **early May**.

IMPORTANT REQUIREMENT FOR ALL ACCEPTED PROPOSALS  

Summer contributors will be required to provide short bi-weekly status updates. These will help the mentors and the Org Admins see that your project is on track. They are also meant to provide a basis for blog posts to be completed by the contributors and highlighted by the organization admins.  

Mentors and Org Admins expect summer contributors to act professionally and respect the mentor's time and efforts. As with any professional setting, it is the responsibility of the contributor/student to inform their mentor if they will be taking any vacations or if they have any other obligation that conflicts with the proposed workplan. Not informing the mentor of these conflicts can result in removal from the program.  

Contributors will be expected to attend all-hands and other group meetings throughout the program. These meetings will be via zoom and held at various times of day to allow participation for a wide range of time zones.
