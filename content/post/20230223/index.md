The [UC Open Source Research Experience (OSRE)](/osre) offers your organization the chance to participate in projects that can help your development cycles run faster, benefit from wide collaborations, and help support workforce development in domains your organization needs.  

To become a sponsor, fill out the [Sponsorship Interest Form](https://forms.gle/9ZTg7pMwa1dQ94NS6). You will be asked to indicate the level of sponsorship you would like to fund and [the open source projects](/osre/#projects) you are most interested in engaging with. 

### Overview of Program

The OSRE includes University of California-based open source projects covering multiple disciplines. Our mentors, who are faculty and researchers from throughout the UC system, have provided a [list of project ideas](/osre/#projects) that will be the basis for the OSRE student’s work.  

Launched in 2020, the Open Source Research Experience program has developed into a marketplace for open source project ideas that matches students to mentors, and engages sponsoring organizations to fund and participate in open source based summer internships. The goal of this program is to increase student capabilities in working in open source, add productive contributors to on-going projects, and further promote open source as a way to engage with communities spanning industry and academia.  

OSRE mentors have posted their project ideas for undergraduates to review and help them create proposals for the summer. Industry partners and other outside sponsors can sponsor OSRE summer student funding and indicate their interest in particular projects.

### Benefits of sponsorship

- Collaborating on innovative project that are of strategic interest to your industry;
- Supporting the teaching of open source techniques to a wide range of student contributors;
- Interacting with the next generation of open source leaders and up and coming talent; and
- Recognition as an OSRE Sponsor at the Open Source Research Symposium (Fall 2023)
