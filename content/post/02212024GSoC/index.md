We are excited to have once again been selected as a [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) Mentor Organization. The [2024 Open Source Research Experience](/osre24) (and with it the [2024 Summer of Reproducibility](/sor24) ) will once again benefit from GSOC's world-wide outreach and generous funding of contributors. We are now listed among [190 selected mentor organizations](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/organizations). See our [organization page](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/organizations/uc-ospo) on the GSoC 2024 site.
