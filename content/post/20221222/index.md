The UCSC Open Source Program Office is excited to introduce the [2023 Summer of Reproducibility (SoR 2023)](/sor) into the [Open Source Research Experience (OSRE)](https://ospo.ucsc.edu/osre/) program and is looking for researchers and academics interested in being an SoR mentor.
 
For those of you unfamiliar with the OSRE, this program is modeled after the [Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)  which matches undergraduate student contributors with mentors working on open source projects. The goal of the OSRE program is to seed contributor communities of UC-based open source research efforts and to help make computational research efforts reproducible. With this program the OSPO participates as mentor organization in GSoC and other outreach and sponsorship programs.
 
The OSRE began in 2020 and has included mentors from multiple UC campuses. (Find information about the 2022 OSRE [here](https://cross.ucsc.edu/2022-osre/index.html).)  The Summer of Reproducibility (SoR) program is a new joint program with the new NSF-funded, collaborative Repeto Project ([U Chicago](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2226406), [UC Santa Cruz](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2226407), [NYU Tandon](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2226408)). The SoR will focus on producing and using [reproducibility artifacts](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-and-badging-current) as well as give summer students the opportunity to help out in this cutting-edge effort and acquire valuable skills related to reproducibility.
 
We will give a brief overview of the program and discuss the benefits of being an OSRE mentor. Join us on January 18 at 10:00am Pacific Time to hear about the Summer of Reproducibility followed immediately by an overview of the general OSRE program. [Registration for this online event is now open](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQe-6Nz8UkEhcA2yw3aM0OVa9cCSe8VSeDW2brkK1UWSnSnQ/viewform). We will be asking a number of our mentors of the OSRE 2022 program to join in the discussion to share their experiences and we will also highlight the changes in the 2023 program aimed at making the OSRE even more rewarding for both mentors and students.
 
For a quick overview of what to expect of the OSRE 2023 please [see information](https://ospo.ucsc.edu/osre/) on the OSPO website. We are also happy to answer any questions prior to the January 18 session.
 
Please feel free to share this information with any colleagues who you think might be interested or could benefit from participating in this program.
