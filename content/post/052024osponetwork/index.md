In Spring 2024, the [Alfred P. Sloan Foundation](https://sloan.org/) awarded a team of six UC campuses a $1.85million grant to further the on-going work of the UCSC Open Source Program Office (OSPO) at UC Santa Cruz aimed at promoting open source research, teaching, and public service in the UC system. UCSC is collaborating with partners at Berkeley, Davis, Los Angeles, Santa Barbara and San Diego  to institutionalize the OSPO approach in the UC system by creating coordinated activities that support local campus OSPOs and building a network that can leverage multi-campus efforts. 

Full reporting on this Sloan Funding and the UC OSPO Network grant can be found in [this UCSC news release]([https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/05/sloan-foundation-program.html](https://news.ucsc.edu/2024/04/uc-ospo-network.html))

The UCSC OSPO were excited to host the Kick-Off meeting for the network on May 31, 2024. In this meeting the network discussed governance issues and further understanding how to work together to build a UC-wide open source community. This meeting helped start the process for the UC OSPO Network to establish coordinated activities at each participating campus and provided a level of shared understanding.
