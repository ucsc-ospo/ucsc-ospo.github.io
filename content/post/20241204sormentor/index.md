The OSRE organizers will give a brief overview of the Summer of Reproducibility (SoR) 2025 program and discuss the benefits of being an SoR mentor at a **Mentor Info Session** on December 4, 2024 8:30am Pacific Time / 11:30 Eastern Time**.

The OSRE and the SoR is modeled after the [Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) which matches undergraduate student contributors with mentors working on open source projects. One goal of the OSRE program is to help make computational research efforts reproducible with our NSF funded Summer of Reproducibility. The OSRE leverages our involvement in global programs like GSoC to recruit students from around the world. All students are paid a stipend and mentors are provided administrative and other needed support to allow for a productive summer.  

The [OSRE 2024](/osre24) supported the work of [40 successful summer projects](/osre24/#studentpages) and we are looking to expand that number even further this year. But we need mentors to work with our amazing students. Mentors from previous years have spoken highly of their experience:  

> The OSRE funded student … helped us create detailed docs and scripts to easily reproduce our project evaluations. This not only eases our own future work, but also helps us promote our work as other people can easily reproduce our results.  

> [The program] provided us a great platform to connect with great students and have them join our projects and make progress.  

> [The OSRE] can be very useful for the sustainability of academic open source projects. It can help identify potential contributors and kick-start the design and implementation of new features. 

At the December 4th meeting, we will give a brief overview of the program and discuss the benefits of being a mentor. We will be asking a number of our mentors from previous years to join in the discussion to share their experiences. We will also highlight the changes in the 2025 program aimed at making the OSRE even more rewarding for both mentors and students.
