UC Network Joins UN OSPOs For Good to Enhance Global Collaboration on Sustainability Goals

From July 9-10, 2024, representatives from the six campuses working to build a network of Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) within the University of California (UC) system were part of the OSPOs For Good event at the United Nations Headquarters in New York. This major event, which brought together open source experts and leaders from industry, governments and non-governmental organizations, highlighted how OSPOs working together across multiple sectors can help build networks of collaboration. 

The event was kicked off with a panel that laid out how open source and working in open environments could help the UN and other international organizations in meeting the [17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)](https://sdgs.un.org/goals).  As noted by Astor Nummelin Carlberg, Executive Director, OpenForum Europe, the UN exists because some challenges are too complex for nations to tackle alone; similarly open source exists so that we can do more together and find ways to collaborate. Ambassador Philip Thigo, Special Envoy on Technology, Government of Kenya (co-sponsor of event) further noted in the opening session that open source shows the promise of enabling diverse communities, pointing at the vast contributions of people from the Global South to open source projects throughout the world. Full video for the event is available on the UN website:
- July 9 [Morning Session](https://webtv.un.org/en/asset/k1m/k1ma4k9rff) & [Afternoon Session](https://webtv.un.org/en/asset/k1u/k1uvv0xd6d)
- July 10 [Morning Session](https://webtv.un.org/en/asset/k1q/k1qmxhno3c) & [Afternoon Session](https://webtv.un.org/en/asset/k15/k1517v486n) 

The presence of members of the UC OSPO network was seen as a major indicator of how OSPOs working together could improve collaboration and coordination across different sectors. These discussions were particularly highlighted in the [July 11 follow up meeting](http://whatsnext4oss.org) hosted by Apache Foundation and Linux Foundation in collaboration with organizers from OSPO++. This meeting entitled “What’s Next for Open Source: Workshops for Building Solutions with Open Innovation” helped participants from the UN sponsored conference look at ways that open source networks can enable global cooperation. That meeting included workshops and presentations from three UC OSPO network members and provided a forum for highlighting how the newly formed network could become a model for other sectors to follow. The UN event and the action focused workshops were also vital for the network and our partners to see how our activities could support the UN SDG’s and have a positive impact on the communities we call home.
