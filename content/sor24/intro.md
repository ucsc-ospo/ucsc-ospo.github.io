title: "2024 Summer of Reproducibility"
subtitle: "Matching reproducibility researchers with summer students and sponsors."
summary: "The Summer of Reproducibility (SoR) is a collaboration between the Open Source Research Experience (OSRE) organized by the OSPO UC Santa Cruz and the REPETO project. SoR provides summer support for undergraduate and graduate students contributing to open source research efforts. The goal of the program is to seed open source research efforts in reproducibility. Our participation in the Google Summer of Code is included as part of this mentorship program."

  label: "Quite a few [conferences](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1--Q2D0YwgNxqUfQjJohni61d554r3HpPmnjUSaKRRKQ/edit?usp=sharing) are now offering awards for reproducibility artifacts. This encourages authors to *produce* reproducibility artifacts. There is great potential for *using* these artifacts not only for validating research results but also as teaching tools in classrooms and as baselines in research labs. Making producing and using reproducibility artifacts easier can significantly accelerate the rate of insights. The Summer of Reproducibility gives summer students the opportunity to help out in this cutting-edge effort and acquire valuable skills related to reproducibility. The Summer of Reproducibility (SoR) is a collaboration between the Open Source Research Experience (OSRE) organized by the OSPO UC Santa Cruz and the REPETO project. SoR provides support for undergraduate and graduate students contributing to open source research efforts. The goal of the program is to help make computational research efforts reproducible. The REPETO project is funded by the [NSF FAIROS RCN program](https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/findable-accessible-interoperable-reusable-open) and is a collaboration of [Kate Keahey, U Chicago (lead PI), Haryadi Gunawi, U Chicago (co-PI)](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2226406), [Carlos Maltzahn, UC Santa Cruz (PI)](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2226407), and [Fraida Fund, NYU Tandon (PI)](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2226408)."

A new part of the 2023 Open Source Research Experience is the **Summer of Reproducibility** with research projects around producing and using [reproducibility artifacts](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-and-badging-current) (see also [ctuning.org](https://ctuning.org/ae/) and [sysartifacts](https://sysartifacts.github.io)).
