# 2024 Summer of Reproducibility

### Matching reproducibility researchers with summer students and sponsors.

#### The **Summer of Reproducibility** is again part of the [2024 Open Source Research Experience](/osre24) focusing on research projects around producing and using [reproducibility artifacts](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-and-badging-current) (see also [ctuning.org](https://ctuning.org/ae/) and [sysartifacts](https://sysartifacts.github.io)).

**We are currently accepting project ideas until February 22 (extended deadline). See the important links below for instructions on how to submit a project idea.**

## Overview
Quite a few [conferences](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1--Q2D0YwgNxqUfQjJohni61d554r3HpPmnjUSaKRRKQ/edit?usp=sharing) are now offering awards for reproducibility artifacts. This encourages authors to *produce* reproducibility artifacts. There is great potential for *using* these artifacts not only for validating research results but also as teaching tools in classrooms and as baselines in research labs. Simplifying the process of producing and using reproducibility artifacts can significantly accelerate the rate of insights. The Summer of Reproducibility gives summer students the opportunity to help out in this cutting-edge effort and acquire valuable skills related to reproducibility. The Summer of Reproducibility (SoR) is a collaboration between the Open Source Research Experience (OSRE) organized by the OSPO UC Santa Cruz and the [REPETO project](https://voices.uchicago.edu/repeto/). SoR provides support for undergraduate and graduate students contributing to open source research efforts. The goal of the program is to help make computational research efforts reproducible. [REPETO](https://voices.uchicago.edu/repeto/) is funded by the [NSF FAIROS RCN program](https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/findable-accessible-interoperable-reusable-open) and is a collaboration of [Kate Keahey, U Chicago (lead PI), Haryadi Gunawi, U Chicago (co-PI)](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2226406), [Cormac Flanagan (PI) and Stephanie Lieggi (co-PI), UC Santa Cruz](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2226407), and [Fraida Fund, NYU Tandon (PI)](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2226408).

In 2023, we supported 19 SoR Fellows from around the world working with mentors who were top experts in their field. (For more on last year’s projects check out the [OSRE23 student/fellows page](https://ucsc-ospo.github.io/osre23/#studentpages) and select the #reproducibility tag.) The Summer of Reproducibility 2024 is looking to work with even more mentors and fellows this year. SoR2024 will provide support for undergraduates, graduate students, and other newcomers to the field who want to contribute to open source research related to making computational research efforts reproducible. The SoR allows selected students and other contributors (our “SoR Fellows”) to help in this cutting-edge effort and acquire valuable skills.

## Submitting a Project Idea for SoR 2024
If you are interested in being a SoR mentor the first step is to create “project ideas” ([see instructions for submitting project ideas](https://ucsc-ospo.github.io/osredocs/formentors/)) for students to base their proposals around. A project idea is a brief overview of the activity/task a student would work on over the summer. Project ideas are compiled and published on the [OSRE 2024 webpage](https://ucsc-ospo.github.io/osre24/) for potential summer contributors/fellows to browse and build a project proposal around.

SoR mentors are typically researchers or faculty from any university or organization looking to support the development and use of reproducibility artifacts. If you have questions about being a mentor or about project requirements, check out the mentor information [video](https://youtu.be/toIQD7CSfLg?si=cNgQloe52rAuxJEY), the [Mentor FAQ](https://ucsc-ospo.github.io/osre24/#formentors), or contact the OSRE administrators directly.
