# 2024 Summer of Reproducibility

### Matching reproducibility researchers with summer students and sponsors.

#### The **Summer of Reproducibility** is again part of the [2024 Open Source Research Experience](/osre24) focusing on research projects around producing and using [reproducibility artifacts](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-and-badging-current) (see also [ctuning.org](https://ctuning.org/ae/) and [sysartifacts](https://sysartifacts.github.io)).

Quite a few [conferences](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1--Q2D0YwgNxqUfQjJohni61d554r3HpPmnjUSaKRRKQ/edit?usp=sharing) are now offering awards for reproducibility artifacts. This encourages authors to *produce* reproducibility artifacts. There is great potential for *using* these artifacts not only for validating research results but also as teaching tools in classrooms and as baselines in research labs. Making producing and using reproducibility artifacts easier can significantly accelerate the rate of insights. The Summer of Reproducibility gives summer students the opportunity to help out in this cutting-edge effort and acquire valuable skills related to reproducibility. The Summer of Reproducibility (SoR) is a collaboration between the Open Source Research Experience (OSRE) organized by the OSPO UC Santa Cruz and the [REPETO project](https://voices.uchicago.edu/repeto/). SoR provides support for undergraduate and graduate students contributing to open source research efforts. The goal of the program is to help make computational research efforts reproducible. [REPETO](https://voices.uchicago.edu/repeto/) is funded by the [NSF FAIROS RCN program](https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/findable-accessible-interoperable-reusable-open) and is a collaboration of [Kate Keahey, U Chicago (lead PI), Haryadi Gunawi, U Chicago (co-PI)](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2226406), [Cormac Flanagan (PI) and Stephanie Lieggi (co-PI), UC Santa Cruz](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2226407), and [Fraida Fund, NYU Tandon (PI)](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2226408).

The Summer of Reproducibility 2024 is looking to work with even more mentors and fellows this year. The SoR2024 will provide support for undergraduates, graduate students, and other newcomers to the field who want to contribute to open-source research efforts related to making computational research efforts reproducible. The SoR allows selected students and other contributors (our “SoR Fellows”) to help in this cutting-edge effort and acquire valuable skills.

The SoR is a collaboration between the [Open Source Research Experience (OSRE)](https://ucsc-ospo.github.io/osre24/) organized by the REPETO project UC Santa Cruz team. In 2023, we supported 19 SoR Fellows from around the world working with mentors who were top experts in their field. (For more on last year’s projects check out the [OSRE23 student/fellows page](https://ucsc-ospo.github.io/osre23/#studentpages) and look for the #reproducibility tag)

We are already accepting “project ideas” from potential mentors; project ideas provide a brief overview of the activity/task a student would work on over the summer. These Project Ideas are compiled and published on the [OSRE 2024 webpage](https://ucsc-ospo.github.io/osre24/) for potential summer contributors/fellows to see and build a project proposal around.
To be eligible to be a SoR mentor you should be a researcher or faculty from any organization looking to support the open-source production or use of reproducibility artifacts. If you have questions about being a mentor check out the mentor information [video](https://youtu.be/toIQD7CSfLg?si=cNgQloe52rAuxJEY), the [Mentor FAQ](https://ucsc-ospo.github.io/osre24/#formentors), or contact the OSRE administrators directly.
