We typically support the work of undergraduate students; however graduate students may also apply to work on more advanced project ideas. Please check out the project ideas page and contact the mentor if you have questions.

## Student pages

We will be asking OSRE 2023 students and contributors to share their progress on a regular basis. We are excited to be able to highlight their work through our blogs and in events such as our Open Source Sympoium. See more about how we highlight student work in this [blog](/report/blog-ospo-admins).
