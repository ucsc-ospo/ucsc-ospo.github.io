New projects for OSRE 2023 will be published by end of February. Student can begin reaching out to mentors in late February / early March. Proposals are due April 4, 2023. 

Students interested in applying to any of our projects should join our Slack channel. Email [OSRE Admins](mailto:ospo-info-group@ucsc.edu) to request an invitation.

## Student pages

We will be asking OSRE 2023 students and contributors to share their progress on a regular basis. We are excited to be able to highlight their work through our blogs and in events such as our Open Source Sympoium. See more about how we highlight student work in this [blog](/report/blog-ospo-admins).
