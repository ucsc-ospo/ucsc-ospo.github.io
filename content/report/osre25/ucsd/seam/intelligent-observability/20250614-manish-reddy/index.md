Hi! I’m **Manish K Reddy** ([@kredd2506](https://github.com/kredd2506)), a graduate student based in the United States, and I’m excited to join the OSRE 2025 cohort. This summer, I’ll be working with the [San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC)](https://www.sdsc.edu/) and the [National Research Platform (NRP)](https://nrp.ai/) on a project that blends my interests in machine learning, cloud systems, and real-world impact.

The [National Research Platform (NRP)](https://nrp.ai/) has moved beyond its original vision as a “ScienceDMZ data freeway” and evolved into a distributed cloud supercomputer, empowering research and education across more than 50 institutions. SDSC, located at UC San Diego, is recognized internationally for driving innovation in data, supercomputing, and advanced cyberinfrastructure.

**My project**, "*Intelligent Observability for Seam: A GenAI Approach*" focuses on building an ML-powered service for NRP. The goal is to analyze monitoring data (starting with Prometheus metrics), automatically detect anomalies, and use generative AI (GenAI) for human-readable explanations and root-cause analysis. This will help researchers and operators solve problems faster and keep complex research systems running smoothly.

I am especially grateful to my lead mentor [Mohammad Firas Sada](https://ucsc-ospo.github.io/author/mohammad-firas-sada/), who is personally guiding me throughout this project. I also want to thank Jeffrey Weekley and Derek Weitzel for their support and guidance.  
You can read my [initial proposal here (PDF)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/media/user/e7a9ade92bcf/proposal/gAAAAABoTeP59B2JlNoLcurxCTBvCS0T9by5Tv8ce1Hs6PB629g9rgzeb_8UrJTZfgpdagnHs5NjUtyYlanFb99wPxpTWjWSgwwToS5qh5u_YUfp9p6IzyE=.pdf).
