Helloüëã! I am {{% mention debangi29 %}}, currently pursuing a degree in Mathematics and Computing at IIT (BHU) Varanasi, India. This summer, I will be working on the [StatWrap: Cross-Project Searching and Classification using Local Indexing](/project/osre25/northwestern/statwrap/) project under the mentorship of {{% mention lrasmus %}}. You can view my [project proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dxyBP2oMJwYDCKyIWzr465zNmm6UWtnI/view?usp=sharing) for more details.

My project aims to address the challenges in project navigation and discoverability by integrating a robust full-text search capability within the user interface. Instead of relying on basic keyword-based search‚Äîwhere remembering exact terms can be difficult‚Äîwe plan to implement a natural language-based full-text search. This approach involves two main stages: indexing, which functions like creating a searchable map of the content, and searching, which retrieves relevant information from that map. We will evaluate and compare available open-source libraries to choose and implement the most effective one.
In addition, my project aims to enhance project organization by introducing a new classification system that clearly distinguishes between ‚ÄúActive‚Äù and ‚ÄúPast‚Äù projects in the user interface. This will improve clarity, reduce clutter, and provide a more streamlined experience as the number of projects grows.

Stay tuned for updates on my progress in the coming weeks! üöÄ
