Hello! I’m Kajal Jotwani, an undergraduate Computer Science student from India who is passionate about building creative, interactive technologies and contributing to open source. This summer, as part of Google Summer of Code 2025, I will be working on the Brahma / Allocentric WebXR Interfaces project under the mentorship of **Samir Ghosh**. You can read my complete [proposal here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ne7ADVM72jRuxU7wzRYK8Hvp1zqCUviU0Fh1sTtRWe4/edit?usp=sharing)

This project focuses on creating a formalized framework for building collaborative and cross-platform WebXR-based experiences. As part of its first public release of Brahma- a lightweight open-source toolkit, our goal is to formalize the framework, create documentation, and implement example applications like multi-user games and scientific visualizations. This will help make Brahma extensible and accessible for a wider developer community. 

I'm excited to be working on this project and will be documenting my journey, learnings, and progress here throughout the summer.
