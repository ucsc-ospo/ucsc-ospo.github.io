title: "OpenRAM Layout verses Schematic (LVS) visualization"
subtitle: ""
summary: "This project aims to create a Python-based GUI with a powerful backend system for effective analysis, visualization, and debugging of layout versus schematic (LVS) mismatches in the OpenRAM framework. By processing LVS reports, identifying mismatched nets, and visually displaying discrepancies, the solution will improve debugging efficiency, productivity, and system reliability."

As part of the [OpenRAM Layout verses Schematic (LVS) visualization](/project/osre23/ucsc/openram) my [proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QEBOglVgy20s0v1_vfpFHw8CdIYUbex12TOjSlAe1-E/edit?usp=sharing) under the mentorship of {{% mention jcirimel %}} and  [Matthew Guthaus](mailto:mrg@ucsc.edu) aims to  develop a comprehensive Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) with a robust backend system to effectively analyze, visualize, and debug layout versus schematic (LVS) mismatches in the OpenRAM framework. The proposed solution focuses on efficiently processing LVS report files in JSON format, identifying mismatched nets in the layout, and visually representing extra nets in the schematic graph using advanced backend algorithms. By implementing a powerful backend system, the GUI will streamline the debugging process and improve overall productivity, while maintaining high performance and reliability. The deliverables for this project include a fully-functional GUI with a performant backend, features for visualizing and navigating through LVS mismatches, comprehensive documentation, and user guides.
