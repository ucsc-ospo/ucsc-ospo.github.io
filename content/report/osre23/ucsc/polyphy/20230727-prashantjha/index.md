As part of the Polyphy Project, my proposal was aimed at improving various aspects of the project, including CI/CD workflows, encapsulation, and security. Under the mentorship of {{% mention oelek %}}, I have made significant progress in the following areas:

1. **Fixed GitHub CI Workflows and Release to PyPI:**
   During the first phase, I focused on refining the GitHub CI workflows by implementing new flows that facilitate seamless releases to PyPI. This ensures that the project can be easily distributed and installed by users, making it more accessible and user-friendly.

2. **Encapsulation from Jupyter into Module:**
   I successfully encapsulated the code from Jupyter notebooks into a module. This step is crucial as it prepares the codebase to be released as a standalone module, making it easier for developers to use and integrate into their own projects.

3. **SonarCloud Integration for Better Code Analysis:**
   To ensure the codebase's quality, I set up SonarCloud to perform comprehensive code analysis. This helps in identifying potential issues, bugs, and areas of improvement, leading to a more robust and reliable project.

4. **Migration to Docker from Tox:**
   In order to improve the containerization process, I replaced the existing solution, Tox, with Docker. Docker provides better container management and ensures a consistent development and deployment environment across different platforms.

5. **Research on Community Platforms for Self-Hosting:**
   I conducted extensive research on various community platforms suitable for self-hosting. This will enable the project to establish a thriving community and foster active collaboration among users and contributors.

6. **Enhanced Security Measures:**
   I implemented several security improvements to safeguard the project and its users. These include setting up a comprehensive security policy, implementing secret scanning to prevent unintentional exposure of sensitive information, code scanning to identify potential vulnerabilities, private vulnerability reporting to handle security issues responsibly, and Dependabot integration for monitoring and managing dependencies.

7. **Upgraded Taichi to Utilize Class-Based Features:**
   As part of the project's development, I successfully upgraded Taichi to utilize class-based features available, thereby enhancing the codebase's organization and maintainability.

Moving forward, I plan to continue working diligently to achieve the goals outlined in my proposal. The improvements made during the first half of the GSoC program have laid a strong foundation for the project's growth and success.

Stay tuned for further updates and exciting developments as the project progresses!
