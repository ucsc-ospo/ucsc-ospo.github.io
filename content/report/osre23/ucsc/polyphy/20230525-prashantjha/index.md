Hey! 

I'm Prashant Jha, from Pune, a recent undergraduate student from BITS Pilani. As part of the [Polyphy](/project/osre23/ucsc/polyphy) my [proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y2X1_6_HliYowZn-qHd7x_Hz6QC3-KSe/view) under the mentorship of {{% mention oelek %}} aims to develop and improve the current infrastructure.

Polyphorm / PolyPhy - which is led by
Oskar Elek. PolyPhy is an organization that focuses on developing a GPU oriented
agent-based system for reconstructing and visualizing optimal transport networks
defined over sparse data. With its roots in astronomy and inspiration drawn from nature,
PolyPhy has been instrumental in discovering network-like patterns in natural language
data and reconstructing the Cosmic web structure using its early prototype called
Polyphorm. The organization aims to provide a richer 2D / 3D scalar field representation
of the reconstructed network, making it a toolkit for a range of specialists across
different disciplines, including astronomers, neuroscientists, data scientists, and artists.
PolyPhy's ultimate purpose is to create quantitatively comparable structural analytics
and discover connections between different disciplines. To achieve its goals, PolyPhy
requires a robust infrastructure that is engineered using DevOps, Code Refactoring, and
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices.
You can see an instructive overview of PolyPhy in our workshop and more details about our research [here](https://polyphy.io/).
