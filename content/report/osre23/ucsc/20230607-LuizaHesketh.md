Hello everyone!

My name is LuizaI am an eighth-semester Bsc Biological Sciences student from São Paulo, Brazil. I have been interested in life sciences and technology since my early years of school.

I have acquired good programming knowledge by learning technologies like HTML, CSS, JSON, Python and Figma. I have built a few projects with the technologies I learned and they are listed on my website and on Github.

Recently I’ve been appointed as Executive Director of the Brazilian Association of Synthetic Biology and I’ve been actively seeking to improve collaborations between laboratories by sharing their common protocols for genetic engineering and molecular biology processes, and I believe that the best way to achieve that is to implement a common language for laboratory protocol design that could be used to represent & execute such protocols across diverse laboratories. Whether it is by a machine or a person(or even both), a laboratory protocol should be Straightforward and understandable, that’s why I’m working with LabOP to write protocols for Hamilton liquid-handling robots.
