title: "Proactive Data Containers"
subtitle: ""
summary: "This project's goal is to novel data abstraction for managing science data in an object-oriented manner. PDC's will provide efficient strategies for moving data in deep storage hierarchies and techniques for transforming and reorganizing data based on application requirements. By developing an Python API and command line tools, these objects will be able to be used with ease regardless of the situation."

As part of the [Proactive Data Containers (PDC)](/project/osre23/ucsc/PDC) my [proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pnt-iq9pWD70d_jmSsoJjnbXtIjJGY3IbXFrwyFT4Q4/edit?usp=sharing) under the mentorship of Houjun Tang aims to novel data abstraction for managing science data in an object-oriented manner. PDC's will provide efficient strategies for moving data in deep storage hierarchies and techniques for transforming and reorganizing data based on application requirements. The functionality of the container object themselves are already well developed, so my goal will be to verify the functionality tests regarding the Python API to ensure that it can be used with ease, as well as create command line tools so that it is a complete data object that can be used across platforms and is simple and helpful for the users.
