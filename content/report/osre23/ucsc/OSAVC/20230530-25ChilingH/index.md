As part of the [Open Source Autonomous Vehicle Controller Project](/project/osre23/ucsc/OSAVC) my [proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hDU87aAzbn88vWwOHH0ggIID2W4KKzp8SKF1Lb8LU90/edit?usp=sharing) under the mentorship of **Aaron Hunter and Carlos Espinosa** aims to create comprehensive technical documentation to help onboard new users of the OSAVC controller. I will be writing tutorials and examples to demonstrate how to start with an OSAVC, programming it with the robotic equivalent of HelloWorld and later moving onto more sophisticated explanations. Hence, this will encourage more applications and wider adoption in the field of autonomous vehicles and expand the community of OSAVC users.
