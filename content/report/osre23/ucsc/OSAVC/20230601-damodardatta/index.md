As part of the [Open Source Autonomous Vehicle Controller](/project/osre23/ucsc/OSAVC) my [proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18g-WRZj_7ufIt6YZNn4OG1s7VKi1u5hV/view?usp=sharing) under the mentorship of **Aaron Hunter and Carlos Espinosa** aims to Develop a unreal engine based simulator for testing. The simulator will be using unreal engine for the physics and visualization.

The existing framework uses gazebo simulator with ROS which limit the developement to only Python and C++ programing languages. I intend to develope this simulator with intention connecting it with Python and C++, additionaly expanding support to Matlab so that in future the control algorithm design and validation process becomes easier. To smoothen future developement, i intent to add detailed documentation consisting of the developement period weekly report, examples and tutorial. Upon succesful completion, the project will deliver a powerful simulator with realistic simulation using unreal engine and additional support other programming languages like matlab.
