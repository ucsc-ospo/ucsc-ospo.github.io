As part of the [Open Source Autonomous Vehicle Controller Project](/project/osre23/ucsc/OSAVC) my [proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_w9RfOM6XWruYUDR1d1yo45tQenpTQq5/view?usp=sharing) under the mentorship of **Aaron Hunter and Carlos Espinosa** aims to Develop a tutorial that serves as a comprehensive guide for new users of the OSAVC controller. The tutorial will start from scratch, demonstrating how to initialize and program the controller using the equivalent of a "Hello, World!" program. Subsequently, it will progress to more advanced applications.

Throughout the project, I will work closely with my mentors to ensure the accuracy, clarity, and usability of the documentation. Their guidance and expertise will be instrumental in achieving the project's objectives effectively.

By creating comprehensive technical documentation, this project aims to empower new users to harness the capabilities of the OSAVC controller. It will facilitate their understanding of the controller's functionalities and enable them to leverage its potential in the field of autonomous vehicle applications.

I am excited to embark on this journey, contribute to the open-source community, and make a valuable impact in the field of autonomous vehicles. Stay tuned for regular updates and progress reports as I work towards achieving the goals set forth in this project.
