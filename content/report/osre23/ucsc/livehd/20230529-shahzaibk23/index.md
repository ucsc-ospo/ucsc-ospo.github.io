As part of the [Enhancing and Validating LiveHD's Power Modeling Flow](/project/osre23/ucsc/livehd) my [proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_GtzWf_gCKkreN1-6VSAI4h2BqwKEUDGkNNB1OM554I/edit?usp=sharing) under the mentorship of Jose Renau and {{% mention sgarg3 %}} aims to enhance and validate LiveHD's power modeling flow, a critical feature for estimating power consumption in modern hardware designs. The existing flow requires further refinement to ensure its stability, accuracy, compatibility with a wider range of netlists and VCD files, and overall performance. To address these challenges, the project will focus on methodically debugging the current implementation, establishing a comprehensive validation methodology for verifying the accuracy of power estimates, and optimizing the flow to handle larger netlists and VCD files efficiently. Additionally, the project aims to improve existing documentation by providing detailed explanations, examples, and tutorials to facilitate user adoption and understanding. Upon successful completion, the project will deliver a more reliable, accurate, and efficient power modeling flow within LiveHD, contributing to the development of energy-efficient hardware designs. This refined flow will not only enhance the capabilities of LiveHD but also encourage wider adoption and utilization by the hardware design community, fostering innovation in the field of energy-efficient devices and systems.
