As part of [Micro Architecture Santa Cruz (MASC)](/project/osre23/ucsc/livehd) my [proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aJIF-geNoN49zjkFS1W7yur2-rYCxhrt/view?usp=sharing) under the mentorship of Jose Renau aims to develop syntax highlighting and a vertical alignment tool for Pyrope. Pyrope is a modern hardware description language under development by MASC. Code is parsed with the [tree-sitter grammar for Pyrope](https://github.com/masc-ucsc/tree-sitter-pyrope/tree/main). I am working on developing a query file for the nvim-treesitter plugin. This gives neovim users Pyrope syntax highlighting based on the parse tree. In addition to syntax highlighting, I am working on a vertical alignment tool to improve code readability. These features will improve the usability and convenience of Pyrope.
