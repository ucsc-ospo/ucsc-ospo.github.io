As part of the [Measuring Research Prototypes under Unreported Settings](/project/osre23/osu/missingsettings) my [proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ouFre-qMDCL_LiH5jFNUCOI1yAYHdWcS/view?usp=sharing) under the mentorship of {{% mention wang.7564 %}} and {{% mention yu.3053 %}} aims to understand the impact of missing settings in artifact evaluation. 

The project plans to measure the impact of different missing settings for open-source database systems, such as MySQL and PostgreSQL particularly under the TPC-C Benchmark. The objective requires to run experiments on popular settings that are not reported and fix any problems during the experiments for the target systems. The project will compare the performance characteristics, and analyze the impact of missing settings on the performance of the target systems.
