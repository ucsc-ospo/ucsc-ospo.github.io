Hello! As part of the [Public Artifact Data and Visualization](/project/osre23/intel/artifactviz) our proposals ([proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1egIQDLMQ5eV7Uc-S55-GTiSXdmrC3_Pj/view?usp=sharing) from {{% mention zjyhhhhh %}} and [proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Gf68Pz8v3YjcQ1sWkS9n2hnl7_lsme2l/view?usp=sharing) from {{% mention Roasters05 %}}) under the mentorship of {{% mention vahldiek %}} aims to design a system that allows researchers to conveniently record and compare the environmental information, such as CPU utilization, of different iterations and versions of code during an experiment.

In academic experiments, there is often a need to compare results and performance between different iterations and versions. This comparative analysis helps researchers evaluate the impact of different experimental parameters and algorithms on the results and enables them to optimize experimental design and algorithm selection. However, to conduct effective comparative analysis, it is essential to record and compare environmental information, alongside the experimental data. This information provides valuable insights into the factors that may influence the observed outcomes.

Through this summer, we aim to develop a system that offers a streamlined interface, enabling users to effortlessly monitor their running programs using simple command-line commands. Moreover, our system will feature a user-friendly dashboard where researchers can access historical runtime information and visualize comparisons between different iterations. The dashboard will present comprehensive graphs and charts, facilitating the analysis of trends and patterns in the environmental data.
