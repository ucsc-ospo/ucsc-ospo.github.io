Hi! I am Jack, a Masters student at the National University of Singapore. In GSoC 2023, I will be undertaking the project entitled [Update OpenROAD Documentation and Tutorials](/project/osre23/ucsd/openroad) to improve the user experience and documentation of this exciting open-source RTL-to-GDSII framework, jointly mentored by **Indira Iyer Almeida** and **Vitor Bandeira**. Check out my proposal [here!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_R4zDe2N05LtAsvDKa3w6C98GvIZ8HAI/view?usp=sharing)

This project aims to review and update missing documentation and tutorials in OpenROAD-flow-scripts. A key focus will be on increasing ease-of-setup by updating documentation, setup scripts and docker-based commands. Next, we will also update documentation for the following OpenROAD components: Makefile flow variable, distributed detailed routing, Hier-RTLMP, Autotuner. If time permits, cloud enablement will be implemented, alongside notebook-based packaging to further increase ease of adoption.
