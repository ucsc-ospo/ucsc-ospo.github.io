Hello everyone!

My name is Luiza, I am an eighth-semester Bsc Biological Sciences student from São Paulo, Brazil. As part of the [LabOp](/project/osre23/ucsd/labop), my [proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pJ7UIATZYASXjbLdUosvq08QkhPNTFxZFId9dapNp-o/edit?usp=sharing) under the mentorship of  {{% mention danbryce %}} and {{% mention TimFallon %}} aims to build a conversor that takes normal laboratory protocols and translates them into machine executable protocols. This is possible thanks to LabOP's versatility to represent what a Lab protocol should look like. I´ll be testing this specialization in Hamilton machines that are great for experimenting scalling up.

I worked as Marketing Director and Executive Director at the Brazilian Association of Synthetic Biology and I’ve been actively seeking to improve collaborations between laboratories by sharing their common protocols for genetic engineering and molecular biology processes, and I believe that the best way to achieve that is to implement a common language for laboratory protocol design that could be used to represent & execute such protocols across diverse laboratories. Whether it is by a machine or a person(or even both), a laboratory protocol should be Straightforward and understandable, that’s why I’m working with LabOP to write protocols for Hamilton liquid-handling robots.
