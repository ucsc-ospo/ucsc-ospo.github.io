Hi! I'm Justin, an undergraduate at the University of Chicago. As part of the [Flashnet](/project/osre23/uchicago/flashnet) project my [proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gsNaYUYOgdN2ilpyPOmI7jjLeoZh219J/view) under the mentorship of
**Daniar Kurniawan** and {{% mention haryadi %}} aims to port the Flashnet model into the Linux kernel. 

In this attempt, I will borrow architecture/design choices from LAKE (to take advantage of its integration of ML-focused hardware acceleration in the kernel) and evaluation criteria from LinnOS to test for model inference accuracy. I also plan to support latency "bucket" inference output to improve accuracy. Ultimately, my goal is to gain further insight into best practices for integrating ML models into real-life operating systems like Linux and to inform general design choices for the Flashnet pipeline.
