As part of the [Teaching Computer Networks with Reproducible Research project] my [proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EI0Zhh6YFwufEZ-53VWwhTOyJUuw7-Rf/view?usp=sharing) under the mentorship of {{% mention ffund %}} aims to develop a classroom competition for adaptive video delivery policies, leveraging an existing open-source reproducible result. The competition will challenge students to extend the original work and design their adaptive policies for head-to-head competition against their classmates.The project will involve packaging the existing result for easy reproducibility and building on it by implementing other adaptive video policies from the literature, developing different network settings for evaluating student submissions, and creating an evaluation framework for scoring submissions based on various criteria (so that competition remains fair and unbiased). The deliverables include a functional submission and evaluation process, an evaluation framework, and documentation and materials for course instructors to use in the classroom.
