As part of the [SUSOSP](/project/osre23/ospo/susosp) my [proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1snzaUfBvptLcWP7I8IyKYFuBNfVGxNe9mnYkFXhb5ZM/edit?usp=sharing) under the mentorship of **Emily Lovell** aims to strengthen the underserved segments of the open source pipeline. 

Namaste everyoneüôèüèª!
I'm Nandini Saagar from Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. I am an undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Technology, Banaras Hindu University, IIT (BHU), Varanasi. My interest in open source was first piqued as a freshman when I was introduced to Open Source as a place where people from all communities and backgrounds come together to create software that can have real-world impact, that too in a completely autonomous and self-governed manner! I am so glad that I could transition from just a kid who imagined Open Source to be a fair-eyed dream to being a part of multiple such communities. This journey has been life-defining for me, and that's why I want to help deliver the message of Open Source to all teens via my GSoC project! 

I‚Äôm working on strengthening underserved segments of the open source pipeline. This project seeks to invite and support broader, more diverse participation in open source by supporting early contributors, especially those who have been historically marginalised. It will aim to create content to help and guide new students, provide a medium and platform for contributors to share their experiences, conduct an Open Source Themed Hackathon/Scavenger Hunt, and leverage social media engagement to get young minds acquainted with the technical and open-source world.

Stay tuned to dive into the vast ocean of open source with me!
