This project aims to review and update missing documentation and tutorials in OpenROAD-flow-scripts. A key focus will be on increasing ease-of-setup by updating documentation, setup scripts and docker-based commands. Next, we will also update documentation for the following OpenROAD components: Makefile flow variable, distributed detailed routing, Hier-RTLMP, Autotuner. If time permits, cloud enablement will be implemented, alongside notebook-based packaging to further increase ease of adoption.
