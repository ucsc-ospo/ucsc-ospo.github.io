Greetings,

I am Rishabh Singh, and I am excited to be part of the 2023 Google Summer of code program. My [proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14DRkbF1S0VnPcopd37Io0pgKVQ1bDSN3QMf3Os6JyBA/edit?usp=sharing) under the mentorship of {{% mention kwu %}} and {{% mention bindong %}} focuses on optimizing the [FasTensor](/project/osre23/lbl/fastensor) tensor computing library for efficient usage on GPUs, specifically targeting tensor contraction while preserving structure-locality. This optimization is crucial for scientific applications and advanced AI model training. Throughout the project, I will develop custom computational operations for GPUs, implement FasTensor on GPUs, assess its performance, and provide comprehensive documentation. By the end, I aim to deliver a working implementation, a performance report, and a detailed execution mechanism guide. Leveraging my background in software engineering and machine learning, I will utilize languages like C++ and OpenMP to ensure efficient memory management and data movement. Stay tuned for regular updates and informative blogs as I progress through the summer.
