Hey,

I am Shekhar and I am one of several students who are working on the project [Using Reproducibility in Machine Learning Education](/project/osre23/nyu/eduml) under the mentorship of {{%mention ffund %}}. My [Proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rCzLGIJ8HYCVjY_MfndgrQjAQa2SQbqZ/view?usp=sharing) aims to develop interactive educational materials about reproducibility in machine learning, for use in graduate and undergraduate classes. My project is inspired by my experience in the [Machine Learning Reproducibility Challenge](https://paperswithcode.com/rc2022), where I found that a major challenge for reproducibility was that some details were left ambiguous in the paper I was trying to reproduce. For my project, I will develop an interactive tutorial to help demonstrate how if the methodology details are not fully specified in a publication, then someone trying to reproduce the result will have to make choices that may not match the authorsâ€™, and these choices will affect whether or not the final result is validated.
