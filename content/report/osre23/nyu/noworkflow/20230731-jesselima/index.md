### Summer of Reproducibility - Mid-Term blogpost report

This post describes our midterm work status and some achievements we have done so far in the project [proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YMtPjZXcgt5eplyxIgQE8IBpQIiRlB9eqVSQiIPhXNU/edit#heading=h.nnxl1g16trg0) for the [noWorkflow](https://ucsc-ospo.github.io/project/osre23/nyu/noworkflow/) solution. 


#### My current experiences

I started doing a bibliographical review on reproducibility in the  Data Science (DS) and Machine Learning (ML) realms. It was a new subject to me, and I aimed to build a more robust theoretical background in the field. Meanwhile, I took notes in this series of posts [here](https://jaglima.github.io/). 

Then, as planned, I integrated with the current noWorkflow supporters. From the start, my mentors [Juliana Freire](https://ucsc-ospo.github.io/author/juliana-freire/) and [Joao Felipe Pimental](https://ucsc-ospo.github.io/author/joao-felipe-pimentel/) and I had a weekly one-hour schedule to keep track of my activities. During this period, we also met with other project supporters to brainstorm about our initial proposal. From this meeting, we came up with a plan on how technically approach a noWorkflow new features implementation in the Data Science and Machine Learning realms. 

In this brainstorm, we reinforced that Jupyter Notebooks are, by far, the most frequent setup in DS/ML computational experiments. They established themselves as the fundamental artifact by embedding code, text and enabling execution and visualization. Entire experiments are created and kept in Jupyter notebooks until they are sent to production. And the opportunity at hand is to integrate noWorkflow with Jupyter Notebooks. 

##### Route alignments

Then, our mid-term goal was adapted from the original plan of only selecting and executing a prototypical ML experiment. We added the goal of paving the way for providing a tagging feature for Notebook cells. DS/ML experiments' typical workflows have well-defined layers or stages, composed of _data reading_, _feature engineering_, _model scoring_, and _metrics evaluation_.  In an experiment, ideally, the user would tag a cell on their specific stage enabling to capture tagged metadata into a database. This step supports the ultimate goal of facilitating comparisons, management, and even causal inference across different trials of a DS/ML experiment. 

Based on that, from a technical standpoint, we turned to create a separate table to store the metadata from cell tagging to construct a provenance of these stages. This table should store the cell hash codes and information that can be matched with the code executed within a cell. For this, I wrote all the required patches to properly create a table in the database. As a result, in this initial phase, we have a separate table storing tags and the activation ids of the cells, enabling identify them as part of a given stage in the DS/ML experiment. Simultaneously, I had to encapsulate the cell marking code into a function to make it cleaner. All this was done in Python programming, using fundamentals of OO development and using Git as the tool for versioning.

In this midterm, we had to make some choices along the way. For instance, capturing the provenance of cells through tags is a different solution than tagging code chunks in scripts. In this case, we decided to stick with tagging Notebook cells at this moment. We also opted to start storing the metadata to enable comparisons between trials rather than focus on a sophisticated graphic and user-friendly cell tagging system. We also opted to keep this metadata info stored in a separate table in the database.

##### Next steps

In the second half of the summer, our goal is to integrate this current table with the activation metadata from the execution and then match the tags with the operations they enclose to proceed with comparisons among experiments. Also, we want to be able to mark some variables to be tracked. These variables are hyperparameters of key importance in DS/ML experiments. As a result, we will be able to track code and parameters, and their stage in the experiment and provide more efficient, accurate,  and reproducible experiments.
