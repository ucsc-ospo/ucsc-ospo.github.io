Starting in 2023 the Organization Admins will be asking students/contributors to provide regular status updates which will help us better highlight the work you are doing and track activities within our OSRE projects. These progress reports will also form the basis of blog reports prepared by students in the course of their summer. Blog reports should include links to proposals, presentations, reports, and an overview of the student's experience. 

Your experience is invaluable for future OSRE candidates and for improving the program every year. We will be adding more details and guidelines on these blog posts in Winter 2023.
