Hello everyone,

I'm [Klaus Kra√ünitzer](https://ucsc-ospo.github.io/author/kkrassni/) and am currently finishing up my Master's degree at
the Technical University of Vienna. This summer, under the guidance of [Sascha Hunold](https://ucsc-ospo.github.io/author/hunold/), 
I'm excited to dive into a project that aims to enhance reproducibility in
high-performance computing research.

Our project, [AutoAppendix](https://ucsc-ospo.github.io/project/osre24/tuwien/autoappendix/), focuses on the rigorous evaluation and potential
automation of Artifact Description (AD) and Artifact Evaluation (AE) appendices
from publications to this year's [Supercomputing Conference (SC)](https://supercomputing.org/). Due to a sizeable
chunk of SC publications utlizing [Chameleon Cloud](https://chameleoncloud.org/), a 
platform known for its robust and scalable experiment setups, the project will
be focused on and creating guidelines (and
potentially, software tools) that users of the Chameleon Cloud can utilize to
make their research more easily reproducible. You can learn more about the project
and read the full proposal [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J9-Z0WSIqyJpnmd_uxtEm_m4ZIO87dBH/view?usp=drive_link).

My fascination with open-source development and research reproducibility was sparked during my undergraduate studies and further nurtured by my role as a teaching assistant. Hands-on projects and academic courses, like those in chemistry emphasizing precise experimental protocols, have deeply influenced my approach to computational science.

## Project Objectives

1. **Analyze and Automate**: Assess current AE/AD appendices submitted for SC24, focusing on their potential for automation.
2. **Develop Guidelines**: Create comprehensive guidelines to aid future SC conferences in artifact submission and evaluation.
3. **Build Tools (Conditionally)**: Develop automation tools to streamline the evaluation process.

The ultimate aim of the project is to work towards a more efficient, transparent, and
reproducible research environment, and I'm committed to making it simpler for
researchers to demonstrate and replicate scientific work. I look forward to
sharing insights and progress as we move forward.

Thanks for reading, and stay tuned for more updates!
