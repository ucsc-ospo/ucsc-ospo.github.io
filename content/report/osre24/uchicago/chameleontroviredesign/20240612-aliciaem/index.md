Hello! My name is {{% mention aliciaem %}}, and I'm a graduate research assistant at the University of Missouri â€“ Columbia, pursuing a PhD in Computer Science. This summer, I'm working on a project to [improve user experience reproducibility through a redesign of TROVI](/project/osre24/uchicago/trovi/), as part of the Summer of Reproducibility (SoR) program. Excited to be working with two fabulous mentors; {{% mention keahey %}}, and {{% mention mpowers %}}. 

**Research Reproducibility with a TROVI Redesign**

Researchers constantly face challenges replicating experiments due to limitations in current tools. TROVI, a platform designed to facilitate experiment replication, can be hindered by hard to follow interfaces and difficulties integrating code and data. This leads to confusion and frustration.  

My SoR project tackles these issues by redesigning TROVI to enhance user experience reproducibility. Imagine a user-friendly platform where uploading code, sharing data, and collaborating with colleagues becomes effortless.

**The Redesign's Goals**

* **Enhanced User Experience:** Inspired by user-friendly platforms like Google Colab, we'll simplify TROVI's interface for intuitive navigation and ease of use.
* **Uploads and Sharing:** Uploading code and data, as well as collaborating with researchers are key goals. Integration with platforms like GitHub will further streamline collaboration.
* **Continuous Improvement:**  A built-in feedback loop will allow users to provide input and suggestions, ensuring TROVI constantly evolves based on user needs.

**The Road Ahead**

We're at the beginning of the redesign process. In the next blog post, I'll describe the project's specific goals and the deliverables you can expect. 

**Stay tuned to see how TROVI is built for reproducible research!!**
