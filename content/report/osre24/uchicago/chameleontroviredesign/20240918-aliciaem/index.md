Hello! My name is {{% mention aliciaem %}}, and I'm a graduate research assistant at the University of Missouri – Columbia, pursuing a PhD in Computer Science. This summer, I worked on a project to [improve user experience reproducibility through a redesign of TROVI](/project/osre24/uchicago/trovi/), as part of the Summer of Reproducibility (SoR) program. 

Before even starting this project, and me as a rising researcher, I always saw reproducibility as one of the biggest challenges in research. What I wanted to see was always as reproducibility—being able to consistently replicate experiments and share them in a way that others can follow. 

**TROVI**, is a platform designed to help with this. However, as I joined the project, I knew it had room for improvement, not oly in the user interface, but also in the ease of integrating code and data.

This project aimed to address these challenges by redesigning TROVI to streamline experiment replication, making the platform more intuitive and accessible. The goal was simple: create a user-friendly experience that eliminates confusion and frustration, allowing researchers to focus on their work instead of the technical aspects of running a research experiment.

## Our goals in the beginning of the summer: 

- We wanted to simplify TROVI’s interface for intuitive navigation, inspired by platforms like Google Colab.
- We wanted to make uploading and sharing code and data easier, with seamless integration with tools like GitHub.
- We wanted to create a mechanism for users to provide feedback, allowing TROVI to evolve based on real user needs.

## How was the progress and what we have achieved

I started by conducting thorough UX research and a literature review on reproducibility platforms, establishing a solid foundation for the redesign. With user feedback guiding the process, I created wireframes and low-fidelity prototypes, focusing on making the platform more intuitive.

As the project progressed, I built a higher-fidelity prototype that connected various components of the platform, ensuring a seamless user journey. I then tackled the back-end integration, which tied together the front-end flows with TROVI’s API.

Throughout this project, I received **valuable support and guidance from my mentors**. {{% mention mpowers %}} walked me through TROVI’s architecture and helped me understand exactly what was needed for a successful redesign. Thanks to his mentorship, I not only completed the project but learned a great deal along the way. Thanks {{% mention mpowers %}}!! 

Through iterations and feedback from initial user testing, and we the help of {{% mention keahey %}}, I refined the design to ensure it met the needs of the research community. By the end of the program, TROVI had evolved into a cohesive, user-friendly platform that leads to enhanced experiment reproducibility.

## Accomplishments

- A simplified interface that makes navigating, uploading, and collaborating much easier.
- GitHub integration that streamlines the process of sharing code and data with collaborators.
- A built-in feedback loop that enables TROVI to grow with its users, adapting to their needs as they arise.

The platform is also getting ready to move into **production** and will soon be available for the research community.

## What’s Next?

While the core objectives have been successfully met, future improvements could further enhance the platform's capabilities, such as additional integrations and more advanced collaboration features. User testing will continue to provide insights for ongoing development.

I'm grateful for this opportunity! Thank you for following along!
