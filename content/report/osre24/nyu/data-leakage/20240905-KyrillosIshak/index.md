Hello again!

This is my final blog post, and I will be discussing the second material I created for the 2024 Summer of Reproducibility Fellowship. As you may recall from my first post, I am working on the **Exploring Data Leakage in Applied ML: Reproducing Examples of Irreproducibility** project with {{% mention ffund %}} and {{% mention MSaeed %}} as my mentors.

This blog post will explore how data leakage can occur during feature extraction, particularly with the commonly used **TF-IDF** vectorizer, and its impact on model generalization.

# Introduction

In machine learning, data leakage is a critical issue that can severely impact model performance. It occurs when information from outside the training dataset is improperly used to create the model, leading to overly optimistic performance during evaluation. One common source of leakage comes from how features, such as those extracted using **TF-IDF** (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), are handled. In this post, we'll explore how data leakage can happen during feature extraction with TF-IDF and how it affects model accuracy.

# What is TF-IDF?

TF-IDF is a method used to evaluate how important a word is in a document relative to a collection of documents. It consists of two components:

1. **Term Frequency (TF)**: Measures how frequently a term appears in a document.
2. **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)**: Reduces the importance of terms that appear frequently across many documents.

Together, they provide a weighted value for each word, reflecting its importance relative to the dataset.

# How Data Leakage Occurs with TF-IDF

Data leakage with TF-IDF happens when the inverse document frequency (IDF) is calculated using the entire dataset (including the test set) before splitting it into training and test sets. This means the model has access to information from the test set during training, leading to artificially inflated results. This is a subtle form of data leakage, as it often goes unnoticed.

For example, when calculating the TF-IDF score, if the word "banana" appears more frequently in the test set but is considered during training, the model downplays its significance. As a result, the model may fail to predict correctly when "banana" is important in the test data.

# Why Does This Matter?

If the test data is included when calculating the IDF, the model gains unintended insight into the test set's word distribution. In real-world scenarios, the test data is supposed to be unseen during training. By allowing the model to see this information, you're essentially reducing the uncertainty that the model should have about future data.

# Impact of Data Leakage on Model Performance

Let's consider two cases to understand the impact of data leakage in detail:

1. **When a word is rare in the training set but common in the test set**: The model will underestimate the importance of this word during training, leading to poor performance when the word is critical in test documents.
2. **When a word is common in the training set but rare in the test set**: The model will overemphasize the word during training, leading to poor predictions when the word doesnâ€™t appear as often in unseen data.

### Case Study: Data Leakage in TF-IDF

To see this effect in action, consider a small toy dataset where the presence of the word "banana" determines the label. If the word "banana" appears in a sentence, the label is 1; otherwise, the label is 0. Using **TF-IDF** to vectorize the text, we train a machine learning model to predict this label. 

In the **first scenario**, we calculate the **TF-IDF** using the entire dataset before splitting it into training and testing sets. This causes data leakage since the model now knows the distribution of words across both sets. For instance, if "banana" is more common in the test set than the training set, the **IDF** score for "banana" will be lower across the entire dataset, leading the model to downplay its importance.

In the **second scenario**, we calculate **TF-IDF** only on the training set, ensuring that the test set remains unseen. This preserves the integrity of the test set, giving us a more realistic evaluation of the model's performance. 

In both scenarios, the model's accuracy is drastically different. When leakage is present, performance is artificially high during training but poor when tested on unseen data. Without leakage, the model generalizes better, as it is evaluated on truly unseen data.

# Avoiding Data Leakage

Avoiding data leakage is essential for building reliable machine learning models that generalize well to new data. Here are a few guidelines to help prevent leakage:

1. **Split the dataset before feature extraction**: Always divide your data into training and test sets before applying any feature engineering techniques.
2. **Ensure proper cross-validation**: When using cross-validation, ensure that the training and test splits do not overlap in any way that can leak information between them.
3. **Be cautious with time-series data**: In time-series models, avoid using future data to predict past events, as this can lead to leakage.

# Conclusion

Avoiding data leakage is crucial for building robust machine learning models. In the case of TF-IDF, ensuring that feature extraction is done **only on the training set** and not on the entire dataset is key to preventing leakage. Properly addressing this issue leads to better generalization and more reliable models in real-world applications.

This blog post provided a case study on how TF-IDF can introduce data leakage and why it's important to carefully handle your dataset before feature extraction. By splitting your data properly and ensuring that no test data "leaks" into the training process, you can build models that truly reflect real-world performance.
