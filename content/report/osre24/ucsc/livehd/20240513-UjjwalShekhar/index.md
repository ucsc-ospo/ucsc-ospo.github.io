As part of [Micro Architecture Santa Cruz (MASC)](/project/osre23/ucsc/livehd) my [proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FyQfRVJ2LnPJ9bCBqiylmnc1dOaumed1LQ_N6cK5krw/edit?usp=sharing) under the mentorship of {{% mention renau %}} and {{% mention sgarg3 %}} aims to develop a tree data structure under HHDS to replace the current one offered by [LHTree](https://github.com/masc-ucsc/livehd/blob/34eed40f32669bdab2fbf8fbcc65492660ba40df/core/lhtree.hpp#L526) 

The tree data structure is to be optimized for typical AST traversal and queries. Some queries that are made to this tree are much more frequent than others. Thus a flattening policy will be used to optimize the tree for these queries, at the potential cost of becoming slow for the infrequent queries. The tree will be benchmarked for scalability and performance and is expected to outperform the current version of the tree. Once the implementation is complete, the tree will be integrated into the LiveHD core repository.
