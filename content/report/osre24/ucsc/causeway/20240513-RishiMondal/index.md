Hello! My name is Rishi and I will be contributing to [Causeway](/project/osre24/ucsc/causeway/), a platform for learning to develop web applications using an Angular, RxJS, NgRx, and Firebase stack , during Google Summer of Code 2024. My project is [Causeway : Improving the Core Infrastructure and Experience ! ](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/projects/wTxAXxEz), mentored by {{% mention dlee105 %}}. This project aims to modernize the platform by adding various login options (Google, GitHub, email/password, passwordless) using Firebase Authentication, enhancing the landing page with an about section and improved UI, and introducing section quizzes via Firebase Firestore and Cloud Functions. It also involves developing user and learning dashboards with Angular Material UI and Firebase Cloud Functions, improving the overall UI design with application walkthroughs, providing an introductory demo for new users, incorporating generative AI features, automating deployment and monitoring with Vercel Bot, and adding contact and feedback options. These enhancements will boost user engagement, usability, and the overall learning experience.

Causeway is a platform for learning to develop web applications using an Angular, RxJS, NgRx, and Firebase stack. It aims to bridge the gap in online coding tutorials by providing a holistic approach to web application development, breaking down the process into a hierarchy of micro-roles. This structure offers learners a clear pathway for learning and translates into a clear process for developing an application. In the longer future, this approach will enable learners to contribute to projects by taking on micro-roles for yet-to-be-developed projects. The platform leverages the [Stackblitz WebContainer API](https://developer.stackblitz.com/platform/api/webcontainer-api) to run full applications in the browser for interactive learning.
