As part of the [Causeway](/project/osre24/ucsc/causeway) team, my [proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRghWCQ1QkuRPh2NDllLgEzXwVXvOXZ-8K3B32ItcrtCY19pFhKGV4x53JHGXoHsEhi1PzsOfs35Uf3/pub) under the mentorship of [Professor David Lee](https://ucsc-ospo.github.io/author/david-lee/) aims to enhance web development education through situated learning.

[Causeway](https://tech4good.soe.ucsc.edu/assets/docs/chi-2019-ca.pdf) addresses shortcomings in current online coding tutorials by offering a comprehensive approach to web development using an Angular, RxJS, NgRx, and Firebase stack. By breaking down the complex task of creating a website down into discrete chunks (micro-roles) and tracking individual progress, students can be assured they are acheiving their desired learning goals. With this project, our team hopes to demonstrate the potential of sitatuted learning – tacit knowledge picked up within a real-world context – instead of content-based learning approaches used in sites like Khan Academy and Coursera.

Over the course of this summer, we plan on reinvigorating the pre-existing v1 platform through the addition of new features such as dashboards, quizzes, and in-depth walkthroughs of new potential projects for users to implement. The platform will also leverage the [Stackblitz WebContainer API](https://developer.stackblitz.com/platform/api/webcontainer-api) and [Firebase Cloud Functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions) to run full applications in the browser for interactive and secured learning.
