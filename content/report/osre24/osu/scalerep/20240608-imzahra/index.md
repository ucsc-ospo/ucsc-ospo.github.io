Hi! I'm Zahra, an undergraduate at Universitas Dian Nuswantoro, Indonesia. 
As part of the [ScaleRep](project/osre24/osu/scalerep/) my [proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Jfk7lRNIWfhFLkVHHN_ZkNQiTg4f8-xp/view?usp=sharing) under the mentorship of {{% mention bogdanstoica %}} and {{% mention wang.7564 %}} aims to systematically understand, characterize, and document the challenges associated with scalability bugs in large-scale distributed systems.

ScaleRep proposes a two-fold strategy to address scalability bugs in large-scale distributed systems. First, Bug Analysis and Documentation involves studying recent scalability issues across 10 popular open-source systems to understand bug causes, symptoms, and solutions. This includes pinpointing common challenges hindering bug reproduction and devising protocols to trigger and measure scalability bug impacts. Second, Implementation and Artifact Packaging focuses on identifying, reproducing, and documenting scalability bugs, then packaging artifacts with Chameleon Trovi. This method emphasizes precise bug analysis, establishing reproducible environments, and detailed documentation to ensure artifact reliability and usability.
