Hello, I am Acheme, currently a PhD student in Computer Engineering at Clemson University. I will be working on [SciStream](https://github.com/ucsc-ospo/ucsc-ospo.github.io/blob/main/content/project/osre24/anl/scistream/index.md), mentored by https://github.com/ucsc-ospo/ucsc-ospo.github.io/blob/main/content/authors/chungmiranda/_index.md and  https://github.com/ucsc-ospo/ucsc-ospo.github.io/blob/main/content/authors/fcastro/_index.md over this summer. Here is my [proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w78mE484kfDmWygPCausv6aZxUQwGeI07ohCjvE3TYk) - for this project.

This project aims to develop SciStream-bench, a set of benchmarks and artifacts designed to precisely evaluate the performance of scientific streaming applications across diverse traffic patterns when running over the SciStream framework.

I am excited to meet everyone and contribute to this project!
