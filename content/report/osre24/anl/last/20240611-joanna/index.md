Hello! I am Joanna, currently an undergraduate student studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics and Statistics at Johns Hopkins University. I will be working on [ML in Detecting and Addressing System Drift](/project/osre24/anl/last), mentoring by {{% mention rayandrew %}}  and {{% mention sandeep %}} over this summer. Here is my [proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10RJhuOBMjIKQSg1PklL3ukDlBHUjdt2i/view?usp=sharing) for this project.

This project aims to build a data analysis pipeline to analyze various datasets, both system and non-system, that have shown notable changes over time. The goal is to understand the characteristics of these datasets(specifically drifts), evaluate the efficacy of Aging Detection Algorithms, and identify their limitations in computer system tasks.

I am excited to meet everyone and contribute to this project!
