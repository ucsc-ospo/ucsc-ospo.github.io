Hello, I am {{%mention mahdi%}}, a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Iowa State University, specializing in Artificial Intelligence. This summer, I will be working on the project [AIIO / Graph Neural Network](/project/osre24/lbl/aiio/) under the mentorship of {{% mention bindong %}} and Suren Byna.

High-Performance Computing (HPC) applications often face performance issues due to I/O bottlenecks. Manually identifying these bottlenecks is time-consuming and error-prone. My project aims to enhance the AIIO framework by integrating a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model to automatically diagnose I/O performance bottlenecks at the job level. This involves developing a comprehensive data pre-processing pipeline, constructing and validating a tailored GNN model, and rigorously testing the model's accuracy using test cases from the AIIO dataset.

Through this project, I seek to provide a sophisticated, AI-driven approach to understanding and improving I/O performance in HPC systems, ultimately contributing to more efficient and reliable HPC applications.
