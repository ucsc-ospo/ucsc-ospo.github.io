For students within the University of California system, you are welcome to participate but be aware we may not be able to place you with mentors from your own campus.

We typically support the work of undergraduate students; however graduate students may also apply to work on more advanced project ideas. Please check out the project ideas page and contact the mentor if you have questions.
