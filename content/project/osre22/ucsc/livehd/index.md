### HIF Tooling

|   |   |

| Title | HIF tooling  |
| Description | Tools around Hardware Interchange Format (HIF) files |
| Mentor(s) | Jose Renau|
| Skills | C++17 |

| Size | Medium 175 hours|

HIF (https://github.com/masc-ucsc/hif) stands for Hardware Interchange Format.
It is designed to be a efficient binary representation with simple API that
allows to have generic graph and tree representations commonly used by hardware
tools. It is not designer to be a universal format, but rather a storate and
traversal format for hardware tools.

LiveHD has 2 HIF interfaces, the tree (LNAST) and the graph (Lgraph). Both can
read/write HIF format. The idea of this project is to expand the hif repository
to create some small but useful tools around hif. Some projects:

* hif_diff + hif_patch: Create the equivalent of the diff/patch commands that
  exist for text but for HIF files. Since the HIF files have a more clear
  structure, some patches changes are more constrained or better understood
  (IOs and dependences are explicit).

* hif_tree: Print the HIF hierarchy, somewhat similar to GNU tree but showing the HIF hieararchy.

* hif_grep: capacity to grep for some tokens and outout a hif file only with those. Thena hif_tree/hif_cat can show the contents.


### Mockturtle

|   |   |

| Title | Mockturtle |
| Description | Perform synthesis for graph in LiveHD using Mockturtle |
| Mentor(s) | Jose Renau|
| Skills | C++17, synthesis |
| Difficulty | Medium |
| Size | Medium 175 hours|
| [Link](https://github.com/masc-ucsc/livehd/blob/master/docs/cross.md#mockturtle)

There are some issues with Mockturtle integration (new cells) and it is not using the latest Mockturtle library versions.
The goal is to use Mockturtle (https://github.com/lsils/mockturtle) with LiveHD. The main characteristics:

* Use mockturtle to tmap to LUTs
* Use mockturtle to synthesize (optimize) logic
* Enable cut-rewrite as an option
* Enable hierarchy cross optimization (hier:true option)
* Use the graph labeling to find cluster to optimize
* Re-timing
* Map to LUTs only gates and non-wide arithmetic. E.g: 32bit add is not mapped to LUTS, but a 2-bit add is mapped.
* List of resources to not map:
    * Large ALUs. Large ALUs should have an OpenWare block (hardcoded in FPGAs and advanced adder options in ASIC)
    * Multipliers and dividers
    * Barrell shifters with not trivial shifts (1-2 bits) selectable at run-time
    * memories, luts

### Query Shell

|   |   |
|---|---|
| Title | Query Shell |
| Description | Create a console app that interacts with LiveHD to query parameters about designs |
| Mentor(s) | Jose Renau|
| Skills | C++17 |
| Difficulty | Medium |
| Size | Medium 175 hours|
| [Link](https://github.com/masc-ucsc/livehd/blob/master/docs/cross.md#query-shell-not-lgshell-to-query-graphs)

* Based on replxx (like lgshell)
* Query bits, ports...  like
    * https://github.com/rubund/netlist-analyzer
    * https://www.jameswhanlon.com/querying-logical-paths-in-a-verilog-design.html
* It would be cool if subsections (selected) parts can be visualized with something like https://github.com/nturley/netlistsvg
* The shell may be expanded to support simulation in the future
* Wavedrom/Duh dumps

Wavedrom and duh allows to dump bitfield information for structures. It would be interesting to explore to dump tables and bit
fields for Lgraph IOs, and structs/fields inside the module. It may be a way to integrate with the documentation generation.

Example of queries: show path, show driver/sink of, do topo traversal,....

As an interesting extension would be to have some simple embedded language (TCL or ChaiScript or ???) to control queries more
easily and allow to build functions/libraries.

### Lgraph and LNAST check pass

|   |   |
|---|---|
| Title | Lgraph and LNAST check pass |
| Description | Create a pass that check the integrity/correctness of Lgraph and LNAST |
| Mentor(s) | Jose Renau|
| Skills | C++17 |
| Difficulty | Medium |
| Size | Large 350 hours|
| [Link](https://github.com/masc-ucsc/livehd/blob/master/docs/cross.md#lgraph-and-lnast-check-pass)

Create a pass that checks that the Lgraph (and/or LNAST) is semantically
correct. The LNAST already has quite a few tests (pass.semantic), but it can be
further expanded. Some checks:

* No combinational loops
* No mismatch in bit widths
* No disconnected nodes
* Check for inefficient splits (do not split buses that can be combined)
* Transformations stages should not drop names if same net is preserved
* No writes in LNAST that are never read
* All the edges are possible. E.g: no pin 'C' in Sum_op


### unbitwidth

|   |   |
|---|---|
| Title | unbitwidth |
| Description | Not all the variables need bitwidth information. Find the small subset |
| Mentor(s) | Jose Renau|
| Skills | C++17 |
| Difficulty | Medium |
| Size | Medium 175 hours|
| [Link](https://github.com/masc-ucsc/livehd/blob/master/docs/cross.md#unbitwidth-local-and-global-bitwidth)

This pass is needed to create less verbose CHISEL and Pyrope code generation.

The LGraph can have bitwidth information for each dpin. This is needed for
Verilog code generation, but not needed for Pyrope or CHISEL.  CHISEL can
perform local bitwidth inference and Pyrope can perform global bitwidth
inference.

A new pass should remove redundant bitwidth information. The information is
redundant because the pass/bitwidth can regenerate it if there is enough
details. The goal is to create a pass/unbitwidth that removes either local or
global bitwidth. The information left should be enough for the bitwidth pass to
regenerate it.

* Local bitwidth: It is possible to leave the bitwidth information in many
places and it will have the same results, but for CHISEL the inputs should be
sized. The storage (memories/flops) should have bitwidth when can not be
inferred from the inputs.

* Global bitwidth: Pyrope bitwidth inference goes across the call hierarchy.
This means that a module could have no bitwidth information at all. We start
from the leave nodes. If all the bits can be inferred given the inputs, the
module should have no bitwidth. In that case the bitwidth can be inferred from
outside.
