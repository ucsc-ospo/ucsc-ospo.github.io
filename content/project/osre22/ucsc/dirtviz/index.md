DirtViz is a project to visualize data collected from
sensors deployed in sensor networks. We have deployed a number of
sensors measuring qualities like soil moisture, temperature, current
and voltage in outdoor settings. This project involves extending (or
replacing) our existing plotting scripts to create a fully-feledged
dataviz tool tailored to the types of data collected from embedded
systems sensor networks.

### Visualize Sensor Data

  * **Topics**: `Data Visualization`, `Analytics`
  * **Skills**:  javascript,  python, bash, webservers, git, embedded systems
  * **Difficulty**: Easy/Moderate
  * **Size** 175 hours
  * **Mentor**: {{% mention cjosephson %}}

- Develop set of visualization tools (ideally web based) that easily allows users to zoom in on date ranges, change axes, etc.
- Document the tool thoroughly for future maintenance
- If interested, we are also interested in investigating correlations between different data streams
