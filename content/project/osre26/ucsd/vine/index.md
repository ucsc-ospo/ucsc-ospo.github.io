VINE (Vineyard Intelligence Network & Environment) is an AI/ML research project focused on precision agriculture using the **National Research Platform (NRP)**. This project leverages the innovative demonstration at Iron Horse Vineyards to study how AI and machine learning can optimize agricultural practices through data-driven insights. Students will work with cutting-edge AI/ML technologies, distributed computing on NRP, and large-scale data analysis, while contributing to real-world applications in sustainable agriculture and climate adaptation.

The project involves **AI/ML research** using agricultural data from Iron Horse Vineyards, leveraging the computational resources of the **National Research Platform** for training and deploying machine learning models. Students will work with agricultural datasets including sensor data, multi-spectral drone imagery, and historical records, developing models for predictive analytics, computer vision, and time-series forecasting. The integration of **NRP's distributed infrastructure** enables scalable AI research that can process large volumes of sensor data, multi-spectral imagery, and historical agricultural records.

Students will gain hands-on experience with **AI/ML model development** for agricultural applications, learning how to analyze multi-spectral drone imagery, process time-series sensor data, and build predictive models for irrigation scheduling, pest detection, and harvest timing. They will deploy and train models on **NRP's Kubernetes clusters**, utilize **GPU resources** for deep learning workloads, and work with agricultural datasets for comprehensive research. The project emphasizes using **distributed computing** on NRP to scale AI/ML experiments and create open, shareable datasets for collaborative research.

The platform builds upon the success demonstrated at Iron Horse Vineyards, where AI-driven analytics have shown potential for **10% water use reduction** and improved yield optimization. This project aims to advance AI/ML research in precision agriculture by utilizing NRP's computational capabilities, creating reproducible research that can benefit the broader agricultural and research communities.
