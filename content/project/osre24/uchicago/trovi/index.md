[Trovi](https://www.chameleoncloud.org/experiment/share) on
[Chameleon](chameleoncloud.org) is an open-source service designed to
significantly enhance the [practical
reproducibility](https://wordpress.cels.anl.gov/nimbusproject/wp-content/uploads/sites/116/2023/08/Reproducibility_On_Chameleon-3.pdf)
of computer science research. By allowing Chameleon users to upload, share, and
access packaged experiments and other research artifacts, Trovi aims to
streamline the process of replicating and building upon existing studies. This
capability is crucial in the scientific community, where the ability to
accurately reproduce research results is as fundamental to validating,
critiquing, and extending scientific findings as reading papers. The importance
of Trovi lies in its potential to serve as a centralized hub that facilitates
the exchange of valuable research outputs, promotes transparency, and fosters
collaboration among researchers. By improving the ease with which experiments
can be replicated and data can be shared, Trovi supports the advancement of
knowledge and innovation in the field of computer science, making it an
essential tool for researchers seeking to contribute to the development of
reproducible and robust scientific research.

This project will focus on the evolution of Trovi. It will aim to enhance Trovi
as a tool to advance practical reproducibility in CS research. Students will
evaluate the most important use cases and enabling features necessary to
enhance Trovi's functionality and user experience. With these design insights,
students will then create a robust interface that allows researchers to
integrate experiment code and data easily as packaged artifacts, similar to the
user-friendly design of Google Colab, and build off other users' artifacts to
create novel experiments, similar to the design of GitHub. Furthermore,
students will create comprehensive documentation with valuable insights into
what works well and what requires improvement, creating a dynamic feedback loop
to guide the ongoing redesign process. Lastly, students will actively
participate in designing webinars, creating and posting video tutorials, and
organizing academic events at the University of Chicago to showcase the work on
Trovi. This multifaceted project ensures a well-rounded experience and fosters
a collaborative learning environment.

Each of the project ideas below focuses on a different aspect of the overall
goal to enhance Trovi as a tool for advancing practical reproducibility in
CS research. They are designed to offer a comprehensive approach,
from technical development to community engagement, ensuring a well-rounded
enhancement of the service.
