[PolyPhy](https://github.com/PolyPhyHub/PolyPhy) is a GPU oriented agent-based system for reconstructing and visualizing *optimal transport networks* defined over sparse data. Rooted in astronomy and inspired by nature, we have used an early prototype called [Polyphorm](https://github.com/CreativeCodingLab/Polyphorm) to reconstruct the [Cosmic web](https://youtu.be/5ILwq5OFuwY) structure, but also to discover network-like patterns in natural language data. You can see an instructive overview of PolyPhy in our [workshop](https://elek.pub/workshop_cross2022.html) and more details about our research [here](https://elek.pub/projects/Rhizome-Cosmology).

Under the hood, PolyPhy uses a richer 3D scalar field representation of the reconstructed network, instead of a typical discrete representation like a graph or a mesh. The ultimate purpose of PolyPhy is to become a toolkit for a range of specialists across different disciplines: astronomers, neuroscientists, data scientists and even artists and designers. PolyPhy aspires to be a tool for discovering connections between different disciplines by creating quantitatively comparable structural analytics.

### PolyPhy Web Presence

- **Topics:** `Web Development` `UX` `Social Media`
- **Skills:** full stack web development, Javascript, good communicator
- **Difficulty:** Challenging
- **Size:** Large (350 hours)
- **Mentors:** {{% mention oelek %}}, [Ezra Huscher](mailto:ez@nmsu.edu)

The online presentation of a software project is without a doubt one of the core ingredients of its success. This project aims to develop a sustainable web presentce for PolyPhy, catering to interested contributors, active collaborators, and users alike.

Specific tasks:
- Closely work with the mentors on understanding the context of the project and its detailed requirements in preparation of the proposal.
- Port the existing [website](https://polyphy.io) into a more modern Javascript framework (such as Next.js) that provides a user-friendly CMS and admin interface.
- Update the contents of the website with new information from the repository [repository page](https://github.com/CreativeCodingLab/Polyphorm) as well as other sources as directed by the mentors.
- Develop a simple functional system for posting updates about the project to selected social media and other communication platforms (LinkedIn, Twitter/X or Mastodon, mailing list) which will also be reflected on the website.
- Optional: improve the UX of the website where needed.
- Optional: implement website analytics (visitor stats etc).

### Data Visualization and Analysis with PolyPhy/Polyglot

- **Topics:** `Data Science` `Data Visualization` `Point Clustering` `3D` `Neural Embeddings`
- **Skills:** data science, Python, Javascript, statistics, familiarity with AI and latent embedding spaces a big plus
- **Difficulty:** Challenging
- **Size:** Large (350+ hours)
- **Mentors:** {{% mention oelek %}}, {{% mention kirandeol %}}

The aim of this project is to explore a novel data-scientific usecase using PolyPhy and its associated web visualization interface [PolyGlot](https://github.com/PolyPhyHub/PolyGlot). The contributor is expected to identify a dataset they are already well familiar with, and that fits the application scope of the PolyPhy/PolyGlot tooling: a complex point cloud arising from a 3D or a higher dimensional process which will benefit from latent pattern identification and a subsequent visual as well as quantitative analysis. The contributor needs to have the rights for using the dataset - either by owning the copyright or via the open-source nature of the data.

**Specific tasks:**
- Closely work with the mentors on understanding the context of the project and its detailed requirements in preparation of the proposal.
- Become acquainted with the tooling (PolyPhy, PolyGlot) prior to the start of the project period.
- Document the nature of the target dataset and define the complete data pipeline with assistance of the mentors, including the specific analytic tasks and objectives.
- Implement the data pipeline in PolyPhy and PolyGlot.
- Document the process and resulting findings in a publicly available report.
